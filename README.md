Burger Store console application in Java

Simple console application written in intelliJ.

Demonstrates my utilization of basic OOP (Object-oriented Programming) principles like Inheritance, Composition, Encapsulation and Polymorphism.

Feel free to fork the code and have fun with it. 

An upgrade would be retrieving order input from the user; via the console instead of the current hardcoded object creation in the Main.java class file.
